# Classification-Task-using-TensorFlow.

Solve a classification task using Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow over the OCR dataset.

The task is to train a deep neural network on the training set and predict the labels on the test set.

In this assignment I firstly did the learning with Softmax Regression and after that I did the learning with a different algorithm called Deep Architecture.
