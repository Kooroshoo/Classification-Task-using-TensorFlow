# Solve a classification task using TensorFlow over the OCR dataset.

Using TensorFlow

The task is to train a deep neural network on the training set and predict the labels on the test set.

In this assignment I firstly did the learning with Softmax Regression and after that I did the learning with a different algorithm called Deep Architecture.
